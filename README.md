# RandomNumberGuessingGame

This is my first project in java
It simply generates a random number, allows you to guess what it is and tells you if youâ€™re correct

To try it out you need to clone this repo, then open your commmand line and navigate to the repo
Then compile the file with the command "javac RandomNumberGuesser.java"
This will then create a new file called RandomNumberGuesser.class
Then run it with the command "java RandomNumberGuesser"

I hope you enjoy!
